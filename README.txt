INTRODUCTION

UbuntuMan is a Supybot plugin for browsing online manual pages from the
Ubuntu Manpage Repository (http://manpages.ubuntu.com) in an IRC channel.

The plugin arose from a need to have a fancy manual page browser in
##club-ubuntu IRC channel at irc.freenode.net server.  Several versions of
the plugin was made by the same author, until the Ubuntu Manpage Repository
was decided on.

Thanks to emma and bascule for their continued support and several others
in ##club-ubuntu for bug testing.  Also thanks to Terence Simpson for his
contribution.


USAGE

The plugin provides the following new Supybot commands:

man <command> [--rel <release>]

    Prints a short version of the manual page from the Ubuntu Manpage
    Repository.

manurl <command> [--rel <release>]

    Gives the URL of the full manual page in the Ubuntu Manpage Repository.

Commands accept --rel option, which can be used to override the default
Ubuntu release the manual pages are fetched for.  For example, to see
manual page for the 'ls' command as it exists in Ubuntu Intrepid , use "man
ls --rel intrepid".  If the option is not given, the configured default is
used.
